# Filtering

We support two types of filtering:

### [Column Filter](./column-filter/column-filter.md)
Filtering on a specific column, allowing users to filter data based on values in that column.

### [Advanced Filter](./advanced-filter/advanced-filter.md)
An advanced filter builder that enables more complex filtering conditions across multiple columns.
